1. **Create a minimal reproduction case**:
   - Use the evaluate/diff/intersect/required tools to isolate the problem
   - Start with your full configuration that shows the issue
   - Progressively simplify while ensuring the issue still occurs

2. **Sanitize the configuration**:
   - Replace sensitive values with generic ones (e.g., "secret123" → "value1")
   - Use short, generic identifiers (e.g., "prod-api-key" → "a", "staging-db-host" → "b")
   - Keep the structure and issue intact while removing business context

3. **Get version information**:
   - Use the version tool to get build details
   - Include this in your issue report

4. **File the issue using GitHub CLI**:
   - Use ` + "`gh issue create`" + ` in the gopatchy/bkl repository
   - Include:
     - Clear description of expected vs actual behavior
     - Minimal reproduction case (configuration files)
     - Version information
     - Any error messages

Example workflow:
` + "```" + `bash
# Test your minimal case
mcp call bkl-mcp evaluate --files "test.yaml" --fileSystem '{"test.yaml": "your minimal config here"}'

# Get version info
mcp call bkl-mcp version

# File issue
gh issue create --repo gopatchy/bkl --title "Brief description" --body "..."
` + "```" + `

Tips for minimal reproductions:
- If the issue involves inheritance, include both parent and child files
- For $match issues, include the matching documents
- For encoding/decoding issues, show input and expected output
- Keep file contents as small as possible while reproducing the issue`

	return &promptResponse{Prompt: prompt}, nil
